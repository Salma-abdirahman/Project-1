# Project 1: Global Warming – UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions
DAV Module 7 & 8 - Project 1 Group Challenge

## Background 

![greenhousegas](Images/greenhouse-gas-emissions-606x303.jpeg)

Global warming is unfortunately becoming more evident in recent years and is having a devastating impact on populations globally. We wanted to find out how much greenhouse house gas emissions has been contributing to this. To sample, we looked specifically at the data collection in the UK.

## Who, what, where, when?

1. Who is responsible for most of our emissions in the UK?
* Compare sector vs sector and end user vs end user

2. What is responsible for most of our emissions in the UK?
* Compare the sources of emissions

3. When have emissions been highest in the UK?
* Compare the recorded year statistics

4. How do the highest sectors and sources compare?
* Conclude the trends of overall of emissions in the UK

# Skeleton Plan of Approach to Answering Questions

## 1. Which sector  is responsible for most of our emissions in the UK?
Compare sector vs sector
### Sector v Sector
a. Need to find the total emissions per Sector
b. We need to compare Sector vs Sector emissions to compare and contrast
c. We need to display the information in a visualisation, a pie chart would lend itself well to this data. 


## 2. Which end user is responsible for most of our emissions in the UK?
 Compare user vs user 
 ### User v User
 a. We need to find the total emissions per User
 b. We need to compare User vs User emissions to compare and contrast
 c. We need to display the information in a visualisation, a pie chart would lend itself well to this data. 
 
## 3. What is responsible for most of our emissions in the UK?
Compare the sources of emissions (i.e. fuel type)
### Emissions
a. We need to find the categories of fuel 
b. We need to find the total amount of emissions attributable to each fuel source
c. We need to display the total emissions per source in a visualisation, a bar chart would work well. 
d. We can analyse the data over time to see the growth of one fuel type vs the decline in another. 

## 4. When have emissions been highest in the UK?
    Compare the recorded year statistics
Total Emissions
a. We need to calculate the total emissions emitted per year
b. We need to compare and contrast total emissions for the period 
c. We can display the data in a bar chart and a line graph to show growth and particular years of interest

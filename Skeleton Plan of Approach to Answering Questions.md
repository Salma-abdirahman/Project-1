# Skeleton Plan of Approach to Answering Questions


# 1. Which sector  is responsible for most of our emissions in the UK?
#   Compare sector vs sector and end user vs end user
#
# Sector v Sector - 1. Need to find the total emissions per Sector
#                 - 2. We need to compare Sector vs Sector emissions to compare and contrast
#                 - 3. We need to display the information in a visualisation, a pie chart would lend itself well to this data. 
#
# 
# 2. Which end user is responsible for most of our emissions in the UK? 
#
# User v User - 1. We need to find the total emissions per User
#             - 2. We need to compare User vs User emissions to compare and contrast
#             - 3. We need to display the information in a visualisation, a pie chart would lend itself well to this data. 
#
#
# 3. What is responsible for most of our emissions in the UK?
#    Compare the sources of emissions (i.e. fuel type)
#
#   Emissions - 1. We need to find the categories of fuel 
#             - 2. We need to find the total amount of emissions attributable to each fuel source
#             - 3. We need to display the total emissions per source in a visualisation, a bar chart would work well. 
#             - 4. We can analyse the data over time to see the growth of one fuel type vs the decline in another. 
#
#
# 4. When have emissions been highest in the UK?
#    Compare the recorded year statistics
#
#    Total Emissions - 1. We need to calculate the total emissions emitted per year
#                    - 2. We need to compare and contrast total emissions for the period 
#                    - 3. We can display the data in a bar chart and a line graph to show growth and particular years of interest
